### Tables
A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns.

To add a table in Markdown, use the vertical line | to separate each column, and use three or more dashes --- to create each columnâ€™s header. A vertical line should also be added at either end of the row. Cell widths can vary. 

#### Text Alignment
Align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon : to the left, right, or on both side of the dashes --- within the header row.

- :-- means the column is left aligned.
- --: means the column is right aligned.
- :-: means the column is center aligned.

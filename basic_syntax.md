# Overview
Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors â€” those are noted inline wherever possible.

# Headings
Six levels:

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

# Paragraphs
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

# Line Breaks
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

# Emphasis
## Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

I just love **bold text**.
I just love __bold text__.
Love**is**bold
